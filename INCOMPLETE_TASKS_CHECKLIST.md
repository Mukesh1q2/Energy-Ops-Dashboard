## 🟢 MEDIUM PRIORITY (Nice to Have)

### Features Needing Work

  - Do DMO/RMO/SO actually run?
  - Are results stored and displayed?
  
- [ ] **Advanced Analytics** - Uses mock data
  - Implement real forecasting OR
  - Label as "Demo" clearly
  
- [ ] **Report Scheduling** - Not implemented
  - Would need cron jobs
  - Email integration
  
- [ ] **Testing Suite** - Not implemented

  npm install --save-dev jest @testing-library/react
  ```

---

## 🟤 LOW PRIORITY (Future Enhancements)

### Optional Features
- [ ] Chart Zoom & Pan
- [ ] Dashboard Customization (drag-and-drop)
- [ ] Data Comparison Mode
- [ ] Mobile-specific optimizations
- [ ] Collaborative features
- [ ] API Documentation (Swagger)
- [ ] Monitoring & Logging (Sentry)

---

## 📝 DOCUMENTATION CONFLICTS TO RESOLVE

### Conflicting Claims:
1. `FINAL_COMPLETION_SUMMARY.md` says: **"✅ 100% COMPLETE"**
2. `INCOMPLETE_FEATURES_AUDIT.md` says: **"⚠️ 65% complete"**
3. `REMAINING_TASKS.md` lists: **"25 incomplete tasks"**

### Action Needed:
- [ ] Manual testing to determine actual status
- [ ] Update documentation with realistic completion %
- [ ] Create single source of truth for project status

---

## 🧪 MANUAL TESTING CHECKLIST

### Must Test Before Claiming Complete:

#### Upload & Visualization Flow
```bash
1. [ ] Upload Excel file (200+ rows)
2. [ ] Verify processing completes
3. [ ] Check data in database (actual SQL query)
4. [ ] Navigate to charts
5. [ ] Verify charts show uploaded data (not mock)
6. [ ] Upload different file
7. [ ] Verify charts update
```

#### Quick Actions (8 buttons)
```bash
1. [ ] Run DMO → Check Archives
2. [ ] Run RMO → Check Archives
3. [ ] Run SO → Check Archives
4. [ ] Upload Data → Navigate to Sandbox
5. [ ] Create Chart → Dialog opens
6. [ ] View Reports → Navigate to Reports
7. [ ] Export Data → Download CSV/Excel/JSON
8. [ ] Search Data → Global search works
```

#### Security Audit
```bash
1. [ ] Try uploading 100MB file (should fail)
2. [ ] Make 1000 API requests (should be limited)
3. [ ] Try accessing API without auth (should fail eventually)
4. [ ] Test SQL injection attempts (should be blocked)
```

## ⏱️ ESTIMATED TIME TO PRODUCTION READY

### Conservative Estimate:

| Phase | Duration | Tasks |
|-------|----------|-------|
| **Phase 1: Testing** | 2 days | Verify what actually works |
| **Phase 2: Security** | 3 days | Auth + rate limiting + file limits |
| **Phase 3: Fixes** | 3 days | Fix broken features from testing |
| **Phase 4: Polish** | 3 days | Error handling + caching |
| **Phase 5: Testing** | 2 days | Full regression testing |
| **TOTAL** | **2-3 weeks** | **Before production deployment** |

## 🚨 BLOCKING ISSUES FOR PRODUCTION

### Cannot Deploy Until Fixed:

1. ❌ **NO AUTHENTICATION** → Anyone can access
2. ❌ **NO FILE SIZE LIMITS** → DoS attack risk
3. ❌ **NO RATE LIMITING** → API abuse risk
4. ❌ **UNCLEAR IF UPLOAD WORKS** → Core feature unverified
5. ❌ **NO MONITORING** → Can't track errors/issues
