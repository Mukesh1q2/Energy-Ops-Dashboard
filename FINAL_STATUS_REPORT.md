## 🧪 Testing Checklist

### Immediate Tests (Do These Now)

1. **Test Excel Upload**
   ```
   1. Go to http://localhost:3000
   2. Click "Upload Excel" in Quick Actions
   3. Select any .xlsx file
   4. Wait 2 seconds
   5. Verify: Success message appears
   6. Verify: Modal auto-closes
   ```

2. **Test One-Click Plot**
   ```
   1. Go to Sandbox → Data Sources
   2. Find uploaded file
   3. Click "One-Click Plot" button
   4. Verify: Chart suggestions appear
   5. Select a few charts
   6. Click "Add to Dashboard"
   7. Verify: Charts created
   ```

3. **Test Data Source Manager**
   ```
   1. Go to Sandbox → Data Source Manager
   2. Drag & drop Excel file
   3. Watch progress: uploading → completed
   4. Verify: Success toast appears
   5. Verify: Source appears in list with "active" status
   ```

4. **Browser Hard Refresh**
   ```
   IMPORTANT: Press Ctrl+Shift+R or Ctrl+F5
   This ensures you're not seeing cached old code
   ```

## 🚨 Known Issues (Minor)

### 1. Old Error in Browser Cache
**Symptom**: Still seeing "Cannot access file" error  
**Cause**: Browser serving cached JavaScript  
**Fix**: Hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R)  

### 2. React Warning (indicatorClassName)
**Symptom**: Console warning about prop  
**Cause**: UI library prop mismatch  
**Impact**: Visual only, no functionality affected  

### 3. Old Data Sources
**Symptom**: Some sources with status 'uploaded' (not 'active')  
**Cause**: Created before auto-processing was implemented  
**Fix**: Can be safely deleted or ignored

## 🆘 If Issues Persist

### Issue: Still seeing "Cannot access file"

**Check**:
```bash
# 1. Verify .next folder was deleted
dir .next
# Should not exist or be empty

# 2. Hard refresh browser
Ctrl+Shift+R in browser

# 3. Clear browser cache completely
Browser Settings → Clear Data → Last Hour

# 4. Check server logs
Look for: ✅ Auto-processed sheet
Not: ❌ Cannot access file
```

**Fix**:
```bash
# Nuclear option: Delete everything and rebuild
Remove-Item -Path .next -Recurse -Force
npm run build
npx nodemon --exec "npx tsx server.ts" --watch server.ts --watch "src/**/*"
```

### Issue: One-Click Plot shows no suggestions

**Check**:
```bash
npx tsx debug-test.ts
# Look for: "Found source ready for One-Click Plot"
```

**Fix**:
- Delete old data sources
- Upload a fresh file
- Check that status is 'active' not 'uploaded'
