- ✅ 2 decimal precision for all numeric values

#### New CSV Format:
```csv
Timeblock,DAM Price,RTM Price,GDAM Price,Purchase Bid MW,Sell Bid MW,Scheduled MW,Model Result MW
1,3250.45,3275.30,3180.20,1500.50,1350.25,2850.75,2875.00

  ✅ 1 file(s) deleted

─────────────────────────────────────
Summary:
  - Total files deleted: 1
  - Total size freed: 0.24 MB

## 🚀 Quick Start Guide for New Features

### Using Socket.IO in API Routes

```typescript
import { emitToRoom } from '@/lib/socket';

// In your API route after data operation
emitToRoom('dashboard', 'data:uploaded', {
  type: 'your-data-type',
  fileName: file.name,
  recordsInserted: result.count,
  timestamp: new Date().toISOString()
});
```

### Fetching Stats for Dashboard

```typescript
const response = await fetch(`/api/market-snapshot/stats?date=2025-01-08`);
const result = await response.json();
// result.data contains { totalRecords, avgDamPrice, ... }
```

### Running Cleanup

```bash
# Preview what would be deleted
npm run cleanup:uploads:dry

# Actually delete files older than 7 days
npm run cleanup:uploads
```

## 📈 System Health Improvements

### Before Phase 3:
- ❌ Socket.IO configured but not functional
- ❌ Missing upload handlers for 2 out of 4 DMO datasets
- ❌ Stat cards showing placeholder data
- ❌ CSV exports incomplete
- ❌ Temp files accumulating indefinitely
- ❌ No CI/CD pipeline

### After Phase 3:
- ✅ Socket.IO fully functional with real-time updates
- ✅ All DMO upload handlers implemented
- ✅ Stat cards showing real data
- ✅ Complete CSV exports with all columns
- ✅ Automated cleanup mechanism
- ✅ CI pipeline catching issues early

---

## 🔄 Remaining Tasks (Lower Priority)

### Optional Enhancements:

1. **Upload UI for Main DMO Dashboard**
   - Currently only `/dmo` page has upload UI
   - Could add upload capability to main dashboard DMO module
   - Priority: LOW (existing upload works well)

2. **Unit Tests for Aggregation**
   - Add Jest/Vitest tests for interval aggregation logic
   - Priority: MEDIUM (existing code is stable)

3. **Authentication & Authorization**
   - Add user auth (NextAuth or JWT)
   - Protect upload routes
   - Priority: HIGH (for production)

4. **Rate Limiting**
   - Add rate limiting middleware to upload endpoints
   - Priority: MEDIUM (for production)

5. **RMO Data Upload Flow**
   - RMO charts rely on dynamic Excel tables
   - Add upload UI similar to DMO
   - Priority: LOW (RMO is separate module)

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

### Socket.IO Verification:
- [ ] Start server: `npm run dev`
- [ ] Open browser console
- [ ] Look for: `✅ Socket connected: <socket-id>`
- [ ] Upload data on `/dmo` page
- [ ] Verify console shows: `📡 Real-time features available`
- [ ] Verify "Live" badge shows green dot
- [ ] Verify charts refresh automatically

### Stats API Verification:
```bash
# Test stats endpoint
curl "http://localhost:3000/api/market-snapshot/stats?date=2025-01-08"
```

### Upload Handlers Verification:
```bash
# Test contract scheduling upload
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/dmo/contract-scheduling/upload \
  -F "file=@contract_sample.xlsx"

# Test market bidding upload
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/dmo/market-bidding/upload \
  -F "file=@bidding_sample.xlsx"
```

### Cleanup Script Verification:
```bash
# Dry run
npm run cleanup:uploads:dry

# Check output shows correct directories
# Verify no files deleted in dry run
```

### CI Pipeline Verification:
- Push to `main` or `develop` branch
- Check GitHub Actions tab
- Verify all jobs pass
- Check build artifacts

## 📝 API Endpoints Summary

### New Endpoints:

| Method | Endpoint | Purpose |
|--------|----------|---------|
| GET | `/api/market-snapshot/stats?date=YYYY-MM-DD` | Get stats for date |
| POST | `/api/dmo/contract-scheduling/upload` | Upload contract data |
| POST | `/api/dmo/market-bidding/upload` | Upload bidding data |

### Socket.IO Events:

| Event | Room | Data |
|-------|------|------|
| `connected` | - | Initial connection confirmation |
| `data:uploaded` | `dashboard` | Upload notification with metadata |
| `market-snapshot:updated` | `dashboard` | Market snapshot specific update |

---

## 🎓 Developer Notes

### Socket.IO Integration Pattern:

When creating new upload endpoints:
1. Import `emitToRoom` from `@/lib/socket`
2. After successful database insert, call:
   ```typescript
   emitToRoom('dashboard', 'data:uploaded', {
     type: 'your-module-name',
     fileName: file.name,
     recordsInserted: count,
     timestamp: new Date().toISOString()
   });
   ```
3. Charts listening to this event will auto-refresh

### Cleanup Best Practices:

- Run cleanup script weekly in production
- Set `CLEANUP_MAX_AGE_DAYS` based on storage constraints
- Monitor disk usage with `df -h` (Linux) or Disk Management (Windows)
- Consider S3/cloud storage for long-term upload retention

### CI/CD Recommendations:

- All new features should pass CI before merging
- Add branch protection rules requiring CI success
- Consider adding E2E tests with Playwright in future
- Monitor CI execution time; optimize if exceeds 10 minutes

## 📞 Support & Maintenance

### Common Issues:

**Socket shows "Offline":**
- Verify server started with `npm run dev`
- Check console for connection errors
- Ensure firewall allows WebSocket connections

**Stats not updating:**
- Verify date parameter matches uploaded data
- Check browser console for fetch errors
- Confirm data was successfully inserted

**Cleanup not finding files:**
- Verify upload directories exist
- Check file modification times
- Run with `--dry-run` first to preview
