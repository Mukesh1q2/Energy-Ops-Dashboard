# Dashboard Fixes Summary

## Date: October 3, 2025

## Issues Fixed ✅

### 1. **India Map Visibility Issue** - RESOLVED
**Problem:** The India Map was not visible due to:
- External CDN dependency (TopoJSON file from jsdelivr.net) being blocked or failing to load
- Content Security Policy (CSP) blocking eval() usage in the map rendering library
- Complex D3.js integration causing CSP violations

**Solution:**
- Created a new simplified India Map component (`india-map-simple.tsx`)
- Uses a **grid-based visual layout** instead of geographic TopoJSON rendering
- **No external dependencies** or CDN calls
- **CSP-compliant** - no eval() or dynamic code execution
- Shows 18 major Indian states with simulated capacity data

**Features of New Map:**
- ✅ Color-coded states by rank (Top 3, Rank 4-6, Rank 7-10, Others)
- ✅ Interactive hover tooltips with detailed info
- ✅ Click to select state and view detailed breakdown
- ✅ Animated pulsing effect for top 3 states
- ✅ Top 10 leaderboard with rankings
- ✅ Selected state detail card with capacity, share, rank, and status
- ✅ **CSV and Excel export buttons** built-in

---

### 2. **Export Functionality** - IMPLEMENTED
**Problem:** Dashboard lacked proper export functionality for data analysis

**Solution:**
- Created comprehensive export utility library (`lib/export-utils.ts`)
- Provides multiple export formats:
  - ✅ CSV (Comma-Separated Values)
  - ✅ Excel (Tab-Separated Values compatible)
  - ✅ JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)
  - ✅ Clipboard copy functionality

**Export Features:**
- Custom column definitions with formatters
- Number formatting with locale support
- Date/DateTime formatting
- Automatic file naming with timestamps
- Client-side download (no server required)

**Integration:**
- Added export buttons to India Map component
- Export includes: Rank, State, Capacity (MW), Share (%)
- File naming format: `india_state_capacity_YYYY-MM-DD.csv`

---

### 3. **Simulated Data for All Charts** - ENHANCED
**Problem:** Charts were empty when API data was unavailable

**Solution:**
- Enhanced `Installed Capacity Charts` to always fall back to simulated data
- Created comprehensive simulated data generator utility (`lib/simulated-data.ts`)
- Provides realistic mock data for:
  - DMO (Day-Ahead Market Operations)
  - RMO (Real-Time Market Operations)
  - Storage Operations
  - Generation data
  - Consumption patterns
  - Analytics and forecasting
  - Transmission data

**Data Coverage:**
- State-wise capacity distribution (18 states)
- Technology mix (Coal, Solar, Wind, Hydro, Gas, Nuclear, Biomass, Storage)
- Regional distribution (Northern, Western, Southern, Eastern, North Eastern)
- Time-series data with realistic variations

const handleExport = () => {
  downloadCSV(
    myData,
    'my-export-file',
    [
      { key: 'id', label: 'ID' },
      { key: 'value', label: 'Value', format: (v) => formatNumber(v, 2) },
