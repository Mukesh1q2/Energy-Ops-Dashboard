# DMO Dashboard - Quick Status Update

## ✅ Completed Work

### 1. **Chart Auto-Refresh Issue - FIXED** 
- **Problem:** Charts didn't appear after Excel upload
- **Solution:** Added browser custom event listener to MarketSnapshot component
- **File Modified:** `src/components/dmo/market-snapshot.tsx`
- **Status:** ✅ Ready for testing

### 2. **Sample Data Generator**
- **Status:** ✅ Already working correctly
- **File:** `generate_market_snapshot_sample.py`
- **Date:** Uses current date automatically
- **Output:** 96 timeblocks with realistic market data

### 3. **Socket.IO Integration**
- **Status:** ✅ Dual event listening implemented
- **Events:** Both Socket.IO and browser custom events now trigger refresh

Sample data has been generated for today (2025-10-08):
- **File:** `sample_market_snapshot.xlsx`
- **Records:** 96
- **Date:** 2025-10-08

### Quick Test:
1. Open: `http://localhost:3000`
2. Navigate to: **Day-Ahead Market (DMO)** in sidebar
3. Upload: `sample_market_snapshot.xlsx`
4. **Expected:** Chart should appear immediately without refresh

See `DMO_TESTING_GUIDE.md` for comprehensive testing steps.

## 🔄 Remaining Tasks

### Priority 1: Test & Verify
- [ ] **Test end-to-end upload and chart flow** - Can be done now using testing guide
- [ ] **Verify all existing chart components** - Test other dashboard modules

### Priority 2: Navigation Enhancement
- [ ] **Add navigation quick links** - DMO is in sidebar, but could add home page card

### Priority 3: Advanced Features
- [ ] **Fix autoplot modal** - One-click plot feature needs chart rendering fix

## 📊 Architecture Summary

### Data Flow:
```
User → Upload Excel → /api/market-snapshot/upload → Database
                    ↓
              Emit custom event ('data:uploaded')
                    ↓
        MarketSnapshot component listening
                    ↓
            Fetch data → /api/market-snapshot
                    ↓
              Render ECharts
```

### Key Components:
1. **Upload:** `/dmo/page.tsx` - File upload UI
2. **API Upload:** `/api/market-snapshot/upload/route.ts` - Parse and store Excel
3. **API Get:** `/api/market-snapshot/route.ts` - Fetch and aggregate data
4. **Chart:** `/components/dmo/market-snapshot.tsx` - Visualize with ECharts
5. **Database:** Prisma ORM → `MarketSnapshotData` model

## 🐛 Known Issues

None currently! The main issue (chart not appearing after upload) has been fixed.

## 🔍 Debugging

If charts still don't appear:
1. Open browser console
2. Look for: `"Data uploaded via custom event, refreshing market snapshot..."`
3. Check Network tab for API calls
4. Verify date picker matches upload date (2025-10-08)
