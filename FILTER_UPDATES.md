# ✅ Dashboard Filter Updates - Dynamic Excel Data Integration

## Problem Identified
Dashboard filters were showing **hardcoded values** that didn't match the actual data in uploaded Excel files. Users couldn't filter by the actual values present in their data.

## Solution Implemented
Updated all filter APIs and components to dynamically fetch distinct values from **both** Prisma tables AND uploaded Excel files.

---

## ✅ Updates Completed

### 1. DMO Filters API ✅
**File:** `src/app/api/dmo/filters/route.ts`

**What Changed:**
- Now imports Excel data helpers: `fetchDMOGeneratorData`, `fetchDMOContractData`, `fetchMarketBiddingData`
- Fetches up to 10,000 rows from uploaded Excel files
- Merges distinct values from Prisma tables + Excel data
- Returns combined, sorted, unique filter options

**API Endpoint:** `/api/dmo/filters?type=all`

**Response Example:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "technologyTypes": ["Coal", "Gas", "Hydro", "Solar", "Wind"], // From your Excel!
    "unitNames": ["Plant A", "Plant B", "Plant C"],                // From your Excel!
    "contractNames": ["Contract-01", "Contract-02"],               // From your Excel!
    "contractTypes": ["PPA", "Merchant"],                          // From your Excel!
    "marketTypes": ["Day-Ahead"],                                  // From your Excel!
    "regions": ["Eastern", "Northern", "Western"],                 // From your Excel!
    "states": ["Maharashtra", "Gujarat", "Karnataka"]              // From your Excel!
  }
}
```

**Supported Types:**
- `?type=all` - Returns all filter options
- `?type=generator` - Returns generator-specific filters
- `?type=contract` - Returns contract-specific filters
- `?type=market` - Returns market-specific filters

---

### 2. Main Dashboard Page ✅
**File:** `src/app/page.tsx`

**What Changed:**
- Removed hardcoded filter arrays
- Changed `filterOptions` from constant to state variable
- Added `fetchFilterOptions()` function to fetch from API
- Calls filter API on component mount and module change
- Falls back to basic options if API fails

**Before (Hardcoded):**
```typescript
const filterOptions: FilterOptions = {
  regions: ["Northern", "Western", "Southern", ...],    // Fixed values
  technologyTypes: ["Coal", "Gas", "Hydro", ...],       // Fixed values
  unitNames: ["Plant-001", "Plant-002", ...],           // Fixed values
}
```

**After (Dynamic):**
```typescript
const [filterOptions, setFilterOptions] = useState<FilterOptions>({
  regions: [],        // Populated from API
  technologyTypes: [], // Populated from API
  unitNames: [],      // Populated from API
})

useEffect(() => {
  fetchFilterOptions() // Fetches from /api/dmo/filters
}, [activeModule])
```

---

## How It Works

### Data Flow:
```
1. User uploads Excel file → Stored in ds_xxxxx table
2. Dashboard loads → Calls /api/dmo/filters?type=all
3. Filter API:
   - Queries Prisma tables (if any data exists)
   - Fetches from uploaded Excel files
   - Extracts distinct values from both sources
   - Merges, deduplicates, and sorts
4. Dashboard receives filter options
5. Dropdowns populated with actual data values
6. User can now filter by real values from their Excel
```

### For Each Filter Type:

#### Technology Types
```typescript
// Merges from:
- Prisma: DMOGeneratorScheduling.technology_type
- Excel: Your column "TechnologyType"
// Result: All unique technology types from both sources
```

#### Plant/Unit Names
```typescript
// Merges from:
- Prisma: DMOGeneratorScheduling.plant_name, DMOMarketBidding.plant_name
- Excel: Your column "PlantName"
// Result: All unique plant names
```

#### Contract Names
```typescript
// Merges from:
- Prisma: DMOGeneratorScheduling.contract_name, DMOContractScheduling.contract_name
- Excel: Your column "ContractName"
// Result: All unique contract names
```

#### Contract Types
```typescript
// Merges from:
- Prisma: DMOContractScheduling.contract_type
- Excel: Your column "ContractType"
// Result: All unique contract types
```

#### Market Types
```typescript
// Merges from:
- Prisma: DMOMarketBidding.market_type
- Excel: Derived from price columns (defaults to "Day-Ahead")
// Result: All unique market types
```

#### Regions
```typescript
// Merges from:
- Prisma: All DMO tables with region column
- Excel: Your column "Region"
// Result: All unique regions
```

#### States
```typescript
// Merges from:
- Prisma: All DMO tables with state column
- Excel: Your column "State"
// Result: All unique states
```

## Your Excel Column Mapping

Based on your `all_generator_all_demand.xlsx`:

| Excel Column | Filter Category | API Response Key |
|--------------|----------------|------------------|
| `TechnologyType` | Technology Types | `technologyTypes` |
| `PlantName` | Unit/Plant Names | `unitNames` |
| `ContractName` | Contract Names | `contractNames` |
| `ContractType` | Contract Types | `contractTypes` |
| `Region` | Regions | `regions` |
| `State` | States | `states` |
| _(derived from prices)_ | Market Types | `marketTypes` |

## Expected Results

### Before Updates (Hardcoded):
```
Technology Types: Coal, Gas, Hydro, Nuclear, Solar, Wind, Biomass, Storage
Unit Names: Plant-001, Plant-002, Plant-003, Plant-004, Plant-005
Contract Names: Contract-A, Contract-B, Contract-C, Contract-D, Contract-E
```
❌ **Problem:** These don't match your Excel data!

### After Updates (Dynamic):
```
Technology Types: [Actual values from your Excel "TechnologyType" column]
Unit Names: [Actual values from your Excel "PlantName" column]
Contract Names: [Actual values from your Excel "ContractName" column]
```
✅ **Result:** Filters now show YOUR data!

---

## Testing Instructions

### 1. Check Filter API Response
Open browser console and run:
```javascript
fetch('/api/dmo/filters?type=all')
  .then(r => r.json())
  .then(console.log)
```

**Expected Output:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "technologyTypes": ["Coal", "Solar", "Wind", ...], // Your Excel values
    "unitNames": ["Plant A", "Plant B", ...],          // Your Excel values
    "regions": ["Eastern", "Northern", ...],           // Your Excel values
    "states": ["Maharashtra", "Gujarat", ...],         // Your Excel values
    ...
  }
}
```

### 2. Check Dashboard Filters
1. Open dashboard at `http://localhost:3000`
2. Click on filter dropdown (e.g., Technology Type)
3. Verify dropdown shows values from your Excel file
4. Try selecting a filter value
5. Verify charts update with filtered data

### 3. Check DMO Module Filters
1. Navigate to DMO module
2. Open Generator Scheduling chart
3. Check Technology Type filter
4. Should show actual values from your data

### 4. Check RMO Module
1. Navigate to RMO module
2. Filters should also be populated from your Excel
3. (If RMO has separate filters, they may need similar updates)

## Performance Considerations

### Caching Strategy:
- Filter options are fetched once per page load
- Re-fetched when switching modules
- Could be optimized with:
  - Client-side caching (localStorage)
  - Server-side caching (Redis)
  - SWR or React Query for automatic revalidation

### Data Limits:
- Currently fetches up to 10,000 rows from Excel
- Sufficient for distinct value extraction
- If you have more than 10,000 rows, the API still works but may not show all unique values

### Optimization Ideas (Future):
1. **Lazy Loading:** Only fetch filters when dropdown is opened
2. **Search/Autocomplete:** For very long filter lists
3. **Cache:** Store filter options in localStorage
4. **Debouncing:** If implementing real-time filter updates

## Files Modified

### APIs:
- ✅ `src/app/api/dmo/filters/route.ts` - Now fetches from Excel

### Components:
- ✅ `src/app/page.tsx` - Now fetches dynamic filters

### Helpers:
- ✅ Already created: `src/lib/excel-data-helper.ts`

---

## Troubleshooting

### Filters are empty or showing old values?
1. **Hard refresh browser:** Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows) / Cmd+Shift+R (Mac)
2. **Check API response:** See Testing Instructions #1 above
3. **Verify Excel data uploaded:** Check Sandbox → Data Sources
4. **Check console errors:** Open F12 → Console tab

### Filters don't match Excel exactly?
1. **Case sensitivity:** API normalizes case (uppercase/lowercase doesn't matter)
2. **Whitespace:** Leading/trailing spaces are trimmed
3. **Duplicates:** Automatic deduplication
4. **Null/empty values:** Filtered out automatically

### API returns empty arrays?
1. **Check if Excel uploaded:** Sandbox → Data Sources → Verify status = "active"
2. **Check table name:** Should be like `ds_xxxxx`
3. **Check column names:** Must include: TechnologyType, PlantName, Region, etc.
4. **Check terminal logs:** Look for Prisma query errors

### Performance issues?
1. **Too many rows:** If Excel has >10,000 rows, consider increasing limit
2. **Network slow:** Check browser Network tab for slow API calls
3. **Database slow:** Check terminal for slow Prisma queries

---

## Next Steps

### Optional Enhancements:
1. **Add filter counts:** Show how many items match each filter
   ```
   Technology Types:
   - Coal (45)
   - Solar (32)
   - Wind (18)
   ```

2. **Implement filter dependencies:**
   - When Region selected → Update State options to match
   - When State selected → Update Plant options to match

3. **Add "Select All" / "Clear All" buttons**

4. **Save filter preferences:**
   - Store in localStorage
   - Persist across page reloads

5. **Add filter presets:**
   - "Solar + Wind" preset
   - "Northern Region" preset
   - "Last 30 Days" preset

---

## Summary

✅ **Completed:**
- Filter API now reads from uploaded Excel files
- Main dashboard fetches dynamic filter options
- Filters now show actual values from your data
- Works for all DMO chart types (Generator, Contract, Market)

✅ **Benefits:**
- No more mismatch between filters and data
- Filters automatically update when new Excel uploaded
- Users can filter by actual values in their data
- Seamless merge of Prisma + Excel data sources

✅ **What You Should See:**
- Dropdown filters populated with your Excel column values

## Questions or Issues?

If filters still don't show your Excel values:
1. Share screenshot of filter dropdown
2. Share output of `/api/dmo/filters?type=all` API call
3. Share first few rows of your Excel file structure
4. Check browser console for errors (F12)

The filters should now be perfectly aligned with your uploaded Excel data! 🎯
