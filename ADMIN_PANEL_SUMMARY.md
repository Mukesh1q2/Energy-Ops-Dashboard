## Development Notes

### Mock Data
Currently, the admin panel uses mock data for demonstration. To integrate with your actual database:

1. Update API routes to use Prisma queries
2. Create necessary database tables
3. Implement authentication middleware
4. Add password hashing with bcrypt
5. Connect to your existing data source management system

### Authentication
The current implementation allows access for development purposes. Before deploying to production:

1. Implement proper session management
2. Add role-based middleware
3. Protect all admin API routes
4. Add authentication checks in components

### Performance
For large datasets, consider:
- Server-side pagination
- Virtual scrolling for long lists
- Debounced search inputs
- Lazy loading of components
- Caching strategies

## Support
For issues or questions about the admin panel:
1. Check the console for error messages
2. Verify API endpoints are accessible
3. Ensure proper authentication is configured
4. Review the component source code for customization
