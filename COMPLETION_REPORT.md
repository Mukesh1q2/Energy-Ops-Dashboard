## ‚ö†Ô∏è REMAINING TASKS (Lower Priority)

### Charts Mock Data Replacement (Estimated: 2-3 hours)
These charts still use mock/random data and should be connected to real APIs:

1. **`analytics-charts.tsx`**
   - Replace mockData generation with `/api/dashboard/kpi` calls
   - Lines 72, 84, 87, 88, 246, 257

2. **`consumption-charts.tsx`**
   - Replace mockData with real API calls
   - Lines 58, 69, 107, 215, 226

3. **`enhanced-analytics-forecasting.tsx`**
   - Connect to real data sources
   - Implement actual forecasting (currently random)

4. **`storage/data API`** (`src/app/api/storage/data/route.ts`)
   - Remove mock calculations (lines 77-79)
   - Implement proper state of charge calculations
   - Real efficiency tracking
   - Actual cycle counting

**Why Lower Priority**: 
- These components render and display data correctly
- The infrastructure works
- They just need data source connections
- Non-blocking for core functionality
