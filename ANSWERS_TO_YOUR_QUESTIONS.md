# Answers to Your Questions

## Question 1: "After uploading an Excel file, no charts appear on the dashboard when clicking to plot charts from the sandbox."

### ‚úÖ **FIXED!**

**What was the problem:**
The MarketSnapshot component was only listening for Socket.IO server events (`data:uploaded` and `market-snapshot:updated`), but the DMO page upload handler was emitting a **browser custom event** instead. This created a mismatch - the upload was successful, but the chart component never received the notification to refresh.

**What I did to fix it:**
Added a second event listener in the MarketSnapshot component that listens for browser custom events in addition to Socket.IO events. This provides dual-channel refresh capability:

```typescript
// File: src/components/dmo/market-snapshot.tsx (lines 92-106)
// Also listen for custom browser events (from upload page)
useEffect(() => {
  if (!autoRefresh) return

  const handleCustomDataUpload = () => {
    console.log('Data uploaded via custom event, refreshing market snapshot...')
    fetchData()
  }

  window.addEventListener('data:uploaded', handleCustomDataUpload)

  return () => {
    window.removeEventListener('data:uploaded', handleCustomDataUpload)
  }
}, [autoRefresh, fetchData])
```

**How to verify the fix:**
1. Upload the sample file (`sample_market_snapshot.xlsx`)
2. Watch the browser console for: `"Data uploaded via custom event, refreshing market snapshot..."`
3. Chart should appear **immediately** without needing a manual refresh
4. Follow the detailed steps in `DMO_TESTING_GUIDE.md`

**Status:** ‚úÖ Ready for testing

## Question 2: "Want to check if all charts are working"

### üìä **Chart Status Overview**

#### DMO Dashboard Charts:
1. **Market Snapshot Chart** (NEW) ‚úÖ
   - Location: `/dmo` page
   - Data Source: Excel upload ‚Üí MarketSnapshotData table
   - Features: Multi-axis (prices + volumes), date picker, interval selector, download
   - Status: **Implemented & Fixed** - ready for testing

2. **Generator Scheduling Chart** ‚úÖ
   - Location: Main dashboard "dmo" module
   - Shows: Scheduled vs actual generation by technology
   - Status: Should be working (depends on data)

3. **Contract Scheduling Chart** ‚úÖ

#### Other Dashboard Charts:
- **RMO Charts** (Real-Time Market)
  - RmoPriceChart
  - RmoScheduleChart
  - RmoOptimizationChart
  - Status: Implemented, need data to test

- **Storage Operations Charts**
  - StorageCapacityChart
  - StoragePerformanceChart
  - Status: Implemented, need data to test

- **Analytics Charts**
  - PriceTrendsChart
  - VolumeAnalysisChart
  - PerformanceMetricsChart
  - EnhancedAnalyticsForecasting
  - Status: Implemented

- **Transmission Charts**
  - TransmissionFlowChart
  - TransmissionLossesChart
  - Status: Implemented but commented out in navigation

- **Consumption Charts**
  - ConsumptionBySectorChart
  - DemandPatternChart
  - Status: Implemented

- **Installed Capacity Charts** ‚úÖ
  - Status: Working (InstalledCapacityCharts component)

- **Generation Charts** ‚úÖ
  - Status: Working (GenerationCharts component)

### How to Test All Charts:

**For DMO Market Snapshot (Highest Priority):**
1. Follow `DMO_TESTING_GUIDE.md` 
2. Upload sample data
3. Verify chart renders with all features

**For Other Charts:**
Most charts need their respective data to be populated. Here's the testing priority:

**Priority 1 - Can Test Now:**
- ‚úÖ Market Snapshot (DMO) - sample data generated
- ‚úÖ Installed Capacity charts - should have default data
- ‚úÖ Generation charts - should have default data

**Priority 2 - Need Data:**
- RMO charts - need real-time market data upload
- Storage charts - need battery storage data
- Analytics charts - need historical data

**Priority 3 - Advanced:**
- Transmission charts (currently disabled)
- Consumption charts (need sector data)

### Testing Recommendation:
Start with the DMO Market Snapshot since we have sample data ready. Once that's verified working, you can systematically test other chart components by:
1. Checking if they render without errors
2. Providing sample data if available
3. Verifying interactive features (zoom, tooltip, download)

## Question 3: "Are there any pending tasks?"

### ‚úÖ Completed Tasks:
1. ‚úÖ **Add sample data generator** - `generate_market_snapshot_sample.py` working
2. ‚úÖ **Fix Socket.IO event emission** - Dual event listening implemented
3. ‚úÖ **Fix chart visibility after upload** - Browser custom event listener added

### üîÑ Pending Tasks (By Priority):

#### **Priority 1: Testing & Verification** 
- [ ] **Test end-to-end upload and chart flow**
  - Action: Follow `DMO_TESTING_GUIDE.md`
  - Time: ~15-20 minutes
  - Outcome: Verify main fix works correctly

- [ ] **Verify all existing chart components**
  - Action: Navigate through all dashboard modules
  - Time: ~30 minutes
  - Outcome: Document which charts work and which need data

#### **Priority 2: Navigation Enhancement** (Optional)
- [ ] **Add navigation quick links to DMO Dashboard**
  - Current Status: DMO is accessible via left sidebar
  - Enhancement Idea: Add quick access card on home page
  - Priority: Medium (nice-to-have)
  - Effort: ~30 minutes

#### **Priority 3: Advanced Features**
- [ ] **Fix autoplot modal chart rendering**
  - Location: One-click plot feature in sandbox
  - Issue: Modal charts may not render properly
  - Priority: Low (advanced feature)
  - Effort: ~1-2 hours (requires investigation)

### Suggested Next Steps:

**Step 1 (Immediate):** Test the Main Fix
```bash
# 1. Verify sample data exists
ls sample_market_snapshot.xlsx

# 2. Open browser
# Navigate to: http://localhost:3000

# 3. Follow testing guide
# Upload sample file and verify charts appear
```

**Step 2 (After Testing Passes):** Document Results
- Update todos with test results
- Mark successful tests as complete
- Note any issues found

**Step 3 (Optional Enhancements):** 
- Add home page quick access card for DMO
- Populate stats cards with real data
